# 🚀 30 Days of Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to my 30-day journey of teaching **Data Structures and Algorithms** 🚀.  
This repository is my committed to building, and sharpening my problem-solving skills daily—one challenge at a time.

## 📅 Challenge Timeline

🧠 Each day, I’ll solve one or more problems focused on:
- Arrays & Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Trees & Graphs
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Searching & Sorting
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Bit Manipulation and more!

## 📂 Folder Structure

Each folder contains:
- ✅ Problem description
- 🧠 Explanation/approach
- 💡 Code solution
- 🧪 Test cases (optional)

## 💻 Tools & Language
- Language: Python 🐍
- IDE: VS Code
- Platform: LeetCode

## 🌱 Why This Challenge?

I want to:
- Deepen people's understanding of core DSA concepts
- Prepare programmers for coding interviews
- Build daily coding discipline
- Open-source my learning for others to benefit from

## 📈 Progress Tracker

## Real world applications of DSA
🌍 Real-World Applications of Data Structures and Algorithms
Scientific Computing – Efficient numerical operations, matrix computations, simulations using arrays, graphs, and trees.

Software Engineering – Building performant features like undo/redo (stacks), background jobs (queues), and efficient searching with hash tables.

Machine Learning & AI – Data preprocessing, search optimization, decision trees, and graph-based algorithms.

Web Development – Fast data lookups (hash maps), autocompletion (tries), routing systems (trees), and load balancing (queues).

Mobile App Development – Efficient local data storage, caching systems, swipe stacks, and navigation using DSA concepts.

Systems Programming – Memory management, CPU scheduling (priority queues), and file system design (trees).

Databases – Query optimization, indexing (B-Trees), data retrieval using hash tables and linked lists.

Finance & Trading – Real-time processing with heaps and queues, fraud detection using graph algorithms.

Cybersecurity – Encryption techniques use trees and bit manipulation, as well as pattern matching algorithms.

Networking – Graphs for routing algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra), packet scheduling with queues.
